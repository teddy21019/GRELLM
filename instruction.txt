A typical GRE verbal reasoning sentence composes of the following 10 characteristics:
- Contextual Clues: Each question provides contextual clues within the sentence to guide the selection of the correct answer. The surrounding words and phrases help infer the meaning of the blank.
- Synonym Requirement: The correct answers are synonyms or have similar meanings. This is crucial for Sentence Equivalence questions where both answers must fit the context equally well.
- Contrasting Choices: The answer choices often include contrasting words, some of which are the opposite of what the context requires. This tests the examinee's ability to discern subtle differences in meaning.
- Complex Sentences: The sentences often contain complex structures and advanced vocabulary, requiring a good understanding of grammar and word usage.
- Inference: Many questions require the test-taker to make inferences based on the given information, rather than relying on straightforward, explicit statements.
- Vocabulary Knowledge: A strong vocabulary is essential, as the questions use a range of words from common to advanced levels. Understanding nuanced meanings is crucial.
- Ambiguity: Some questions are designed to be somewhat ambiguous, requiring careful consideration of all answer choices to determine which pair fits best.
- Logical Consistency: The correct answers must logically and coherently fit into the sentence, maintaining its overall meaning and flow.
- Balanced Answer Choices: The answer choices include a mix of plausible and implausible words, testing the ability to eliminate incorrect options systematically.
- Testing Different Skills: Verbal reasoning questions test a variety of skills, including reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and the ability to understand and apply vocabulary in context.
